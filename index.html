                Gameplay
            </header>
            <p>A normal "duel" consists of two oposing players. Each player has a main deck containing at least 40 cards
                and no
                more than 60 cards. A deck can contain up to three copies of the same card. Additionally, for tournament
                play
                some cards on the forbidden, limited, or semi-limited list can either not be used in the deck, only have
                one
                copy in the deck, or only have two copies in the deck respectively. At the beginning of the duel, both
                players
                start with 8000 life points. There are four ways to win a duel:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced the opposing player's life points to 0</li>
                <li>A player is unable to draw a card from their deck when they're suppose to</li>
                <li>A player meets the win conditions of a specific card effect to win a duel/match</li>
                <li>A player surrenders</li>
            </ul>

            <header>
                Game Mat
            </header>
            <p>The Game Mat is where both players will play there cards. Its organized into different zones for where
                cards
                should be played. A physical game mat is not needed to play the game, but both players will need to
                remember
                where to place each specific card when played.</p>
            <p>The zones on the game mat are classified in the following way:</p>
            <h3>Main Monster zone:</h3>
            <p>this is where monsters are played. Each player can have up to 5 monsters in the main monster zone and can
                be
                positioneed in 3 different way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Face up attack position</li>
                <li>Face up defense position</li>
                <li>Face down defense position</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A monster card is in attack position when the card is upright (portrait orientation) and in defense
                position when
                the card is sideways (landscape orientation)</p>
            <h3>Spell & Trap Zone and Pendulum Zone:</h3>
            <p>Like the monster zone, you can have have up to five Spell or Trap cards in this zone. This zone is
                located behind
                the Main Monster Zone. Spell and Trap cards must be activated face up or set face down from this zone.
                It is ok
                to place a monster card in this zone, if an effect says to do this.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the far left and right spaces are known as the Pendulum zone. Spell and Trap cards can
                still be
                activated or set in these two zones. If a player intends to activate a Pendulum monster as Spell card,
                then they
                must place them in the Pendulum zone.</p>
            <h3>Field Zone</h3>
            <p>There are a special Spell Card noted by a specific symbal known as Field Spell cards. These cards can
                only be played in the Field Spell zone which is located to the far left of the Monster zone. Each player
                is only allowed one field spell at a time. A field spell can be activated face up or set face down in
                the field spell zone. When a player is ready to activate or set a new field spell, send the current
                field spell card to the Graveyard before placing or setting the new one.</p>
            <h3>Extra Deck</h3>
            <p>Cards in this deck are face down and is located behind the Field Card Zone. You may look at the cards in
                your own Extra Deck during the game. Pendulum monsters that would be sent from the Monster zone or
                Pendulum zone to the Graveyard would be sent face up to the Extra Deck instead. Monsters in this deck
                may be summoned once certain conditions are met.</p>
            <h3>Extra Monster Zone</h3>
            <p>These two zones are shared by both players. These two zones are located in front of the number two and
                number four Monster zones. Normally, each player may only use one of these zones at a time. Monsters
                from the Extra deck can be played in one of these zones. Link monsters that are Linked summoned or
                Pendulum monsters that are Pendulumed Summoned from the Extra Deck are played in the Extra Monster zone.
                Monsters played in the Extra Monster zone does not count towards a player's 5 monster limit.</p>
            <h3>Graveyard</h3>
            <p>After monster cards are destroyed or when Spell & Trap cards are used up, they are placed face up in the
                Graveyard in the order they're sent there (this order should not be changed). Either player can look
                through their Graveyard or their opponent's Graveyard </p>
            <h3>Banished Cards</h3>
            <p>Sometimes a card effect will banish card(s). If this happens then, the card will not go to the Graveyard.
                Normally players will start a pile of cards that are banished to the right of the Graveyard. Either
                player may look through their banished pile and must keep them in order of when they were banished (most
                recent banished card on top)</p>
            <h3>Deck</h3>
            <p>This is where your main deck will go face down. This is where you will draw your cards from. If an effect
                requires you to reveal cards from your deck or for you to look through your deck, always shuffle your
                deck one you are done before returning your deck face down. All cards in your deck should be face down
                unless a card effect that was played or is currently active says otherwise.</p>

                <li>Type / Effect - All monster cards have a specific type. This is important for card effects that
                    mention
